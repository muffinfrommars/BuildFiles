SCENARIO: 
Aed Massacre, Gran Year 760
Lanzenritter are being wiped out by Travant's Dracoknights. Quan, Ethlyn, and a toddler Altena are all that remain.

[Scene 1]
*CONSIDER: Many quotes from unknown sources. Clearly, a battle is being held. There's lots of noises, and clanking from weapons being thrown, blows being made.

*Still Black*

ETHLYN: ...!

*Fade In*

*She's shown to be fatally wounded by a Thracian Dracoknight. She's only seconds away from perishing. Quan watches from only meters away.

(slow text if possible)
Q-Quan... Altena...
I'm so s o r r y... 

*She fades, dying

[Scene 2]
The Dracoknight that delivered Ethlyn's killing blow picks up something, and slowly flies back to Travant, who is witnessing the action from a distance. The soldier reports what he's found.

TRAVANT: What's this?

*Despite him being commonly depicted as such, Travant is not a cold blooded murderer. He isn't entirely thrilled that a woman was killed in combat. Still, he's not entirely beside himself, as she was Quan's wife, his enemy. On a battlefield, "Mercy is a luxury."

SOLDIER1: Sir...

*A baby is crying

 Travant: ...The woman was foolish enough to have brought a child with her?

SOLDIER1: What should we do? The thing is making too much noise... Should we put it out of its misery?

*Travant quickly asesses the situation. He recognizes that Ethlyn was carrying Altena, Quan's daughter. Something clicks almost instantly within him, and he feigns a smirk.

Travant: Absolutely not. Hand her over to me.

SOLDIER1: I can't say I expected this of you, Sir. Are you s-

Travant: Silence! This is none of your concern.

You there!

*Travant summons another soldier

SOLDIER2: Yes, Milord?

Travant: Tell Quan this: Forfeit Gae Bolg, or his daughter here will meet an untimely end!

Heh heh... Your move, Quan... Your move...

*Clearly, Travant has schemed something up. Within the heat of the moment, his intentions are unclear. The second soldier quickly flies back to the battlefield, where Quan now stands alone

[Scene 3]
*The message is recieved

Quan: N-No! Ethlyn!!

You craven vultures! Travant!!

You can have Gae Bolg, but don't you DARE as much as lay a finger on Altena!

*CONSIDER: Quan charges towards Travant. His path is stopped by numerous Dracoknights. He pivots to flank them, but is stopped yet again. He tries to pivot a third time, but his attempt is futile. He's now fully surrounded.

Quan: So this... this is where it ends...

*Quan backs up to a wall

Quan: Finn... I entrust Leif to you...

*As Dracoknights close in on him, the scene fades
